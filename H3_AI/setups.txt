Rider–Order Allocation – Instance 1 (Scenario Setup)
Road network

We have six locations connected by roads with the following distances (undirected graph):

A–B: 2

A–C: 4

B–C: 1

C–D: 2

C–E: 3

D–F: 3

D–E: 2

E–F: 2

All edges are bidirectional and distances are symmetric.

Riders

Rider R1 starts at location A.

Rider R2 starts at location D.

Both riders:

Travel at the same constant speed.

Can carry multiple orders at the same time (no capacity limit assumed).

Orders

There are three delivery orders:

Order O1: pickup at B, deliver to E (B → E)

Order O2: pickup at C, deliver to F (C → F)

Order O3: pickup at A, deliver to D (A → D)

Each order must satisfy:

The rider must visit the pickup location before the corresponding drop-off location.

Once an order is delivered, it is completed and does not need to be revisited.

Assumptions

The graph is static; road distances do not change over time.

Both riders can plan arbitrary routes through the graph (not restricted to simple paths).

Riders may carry multiple active orders simultaneously (no capacity constraint).

We ignore loading/unloading times; time is proportional only to total distance travelled.

Riders do not need to return to any depot after completing all assigned orders.

Optimization questions (for the LLM)

For this instance, we ask the LLM to find:

Fuel minimisation:

Allocation of O1, O2, O3 to R1 and R2, and routes for each rider

Such that the total distance travelled by both riders combined is minimised.

Time minimisation:

Allocation and routes such that the elapsed time until all three orders are delivered is minimised.

Here, time = max(distance travelled by R1, distance travelled by R2) (makespan).

Rider–Order Allocation – Instance 2 (Scenario Setup)
Road network

We use the same road network as in Instance 1 (same graph and distances):

A–B: 2

A–C: 4

B–C: 1

C–D: 2

C–E: 3

D–F: 3

D–E: 2

E–F: 2

Undirected, symmetric distances.

Riders

Riders and starts are unchanged:

Rider R1 starts at A.

Rider R2 starts at D.

Same assumptions as before:

Equal constant speed.

Can carry multiple orders simultaneously.

Orders

In Instance 2 we change only the orders, keeping the graph and rider start positions the same.

There are three new orders:

Order O1: pickup at A, deliver to F (A → F)

Order O2: pickup at B, deliver to D (B → D)

Order O3: pickup at C, deliver to E (C → E)

Constraints:

For each order, pickup location must be visited before its drop-off location.

After delivery, the order is considered complete.

Assumptions

Same as Instance 1:

Static, undirected graph with fixed distances.

Riders may follow any path in the graph.

Multiple orders can be carried at the same time (no capacity limit).

Only travel distance matters (no separate loading/unloading time).

No requirement to return to a depot after finishing.

Optimization questions (for the LLM)

For this second instance, we again ask the LLM to solve:

Fuel minimisation:

Find an allocation of the three orders to R1 and R2 and corresponding routes

To minimise the total distance travelled (R1 distance + R2 distance).

Time minimisation:

Find allocation and routes that minimise the completion time of all orders,

Where completion time (makespan) is max(distance of R1, distance of R2).
